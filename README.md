## Getting Started

This repository stores the source files of every component of this prototype, but before running it, take a look at the prerequisites to check if you are ready for the deployment.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the hardware, software and other tools to build, test and push 

#### Hardware

- [Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mega-2560-rev3) (Or similar board)
